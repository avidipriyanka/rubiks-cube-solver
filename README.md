#  Rubik‚Äôs Cube Solver ‚Äì AeroHack 2025 Submission

This project provides a complete solution to solve a **3x3 Rubik‚Äôs Cube** using Python in **Google Colab**. It combines:
* Beginner Layer-by-Layer (LBL) solving strategy (easy to understand)
* Kociemba‚Äôs Two-Phase Algorithm (advanced & optimal)

Developed and submitted for AeroHack 2025, Computer Science Track.

##  Problem Statement

Design and implement an algorithm to solve any scrambled 3x3 Rubik‚Äôs Cube using valid cube rotations. The solution should simulate real-world cube logic and aim for correctness and efficiency.

---

##  Features

- Cube modeled using dictionaries and lists
- Applies all 18 valid moves: U, D, F, B, L, R (and primes)
- Uses `kociemba` algorithm for optimal solving
- Works 100% in **Google Colab** (no setup required)
- Outputs correct move sequence to solve any scramble
